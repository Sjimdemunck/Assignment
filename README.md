## Breaking Down the Excel

Attached to the assignment is an Excel file. The file contains data such as studentnummer, questions, max score per
question and the score of the student per question. I need to turn the excel data into a data-model.

#### Data-Model

So in my opinion we need at least 2 entities (maybe 3 because of adding Score):

1. **Questions** which contains of an name and max score
2. **Students** consists of a studentnumber (studentnummer) and ??relation?? maybe score per question and total score +
the 2 calculations?
3. **Scores** maybe the calculation scores should be defined here
